<h1>Project Proposal — Trend of tourist attraction foot traffic</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Tourist sites often get crowded at peak times. Crowds can lower the visitor experience and raise safety risks. Using data to watch 
visitor flow can help sites plan better and help visitors pick better times to go.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The project has three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show real-time changes in visitor numbers, such as holidays or sudden weather changes.</li>
<li>Show long-term trends, such as busy seasons and yearly patterns.</li>
<li>Present the findings with clear charts and short text so people can understand at a glance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>We will use two types of data. Real-time data can come from ticket gates, map heat data, and online booking numbers. Long-term data can 
come from past ticket records, search trends, hotel bookings, and official reports. If needed, we will also use simulated sample data.</p>
<h2>Methods and Presentation</h2>
<p>We will clean and combine data from different sources. Then we will make simple charts such as line charts, bar charts, and heat maps. 
We will put the charts in a single web page. Short text will explain each chart. The page will let readers see both quick snapshots and longer 
trends.</p>
<h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
<p>The result will be a web page with short explanations and clear charts. The page will show when sites are busiest and how patterns 
change over time. The work aims to help site managers plan staff and services and to help visitors choose less crowded times.</p>

<p>Format: text story + visuals. Deliverable: single HTML page with charts and short text.</p>
